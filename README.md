Simple web application for studying to the MCQ exam in MFEL3010 - Medicine for Students of Natural Sciences and Technology. 

The application is written in Python using Flask and html, with great help from ChatGPT as I'm not a front end developer. I gained some valuable insight in how simple apps like this can be set up. The application was deployed online using using the cloud application platform Heroku. 

All questions are exctracted from the course material and earlier exams, converted from multiple PDFs into a single JSON using a combination of automatic formatting scripts and manual corrections.
